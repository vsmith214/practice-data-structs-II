# Test-first Data Structures

*NOTE: you are encouraged to follow the workshop text for this repo, which covers the following in greater detail.*

In this portion of the workshop, we are going to be writing the JavaScript implementations of Hash Tables and Binary Search Trees.

## Running

Assuming you have Testem globally installed (`npm install -g testem`), simply run `npm test` in this project's root directory to test all suites at once. You can also run `testem` from inside a folder to test just that suite.

### Binary Search Tree DS

BSTs are highly recursive structures — many of your methods should employ recursion.

### Hash Table DS

Keeping track of what is going where and how to access it in this suite may be tricky. Good variable and property names will be especially helpful here; try to keep things clear.
